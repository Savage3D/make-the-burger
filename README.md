# Make-the-burger React app
This app is kind of a burger sandbox, where you can add, edit, delete, and change a position of ingredients. 
To start editing a burger just click on any ingredient. Then use buttons to change the shape of the burger.

Have fun.

Here you can find a working demo ==> https://maketheburger.herokuapp.com/
